## Building the project

### Configuring TypeScript compilation

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es5",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "outDir": "dist",
    "sourceMap": true
  },

  "include": ["src/**/*.ts"],
  "exclude": ["src/**/*.spec.ts", "test", "node_modules"]
}
```

### Running the build

All the different build steps are orchestrated via [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts).
Npm scripts basically allow us to call (and chain) terminal commands via npm.

| Npm Script | Description                                                                      |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `start`    | Runs full build and runs node on dist/index.js. Can be invoked with `yarn start` |
| `dev`      | Runs full build before starting all watch tasks. Can be invoked with `yarn dev`  |
| `watch`    | Executes COMMAND on every successful compilation. `yarn watch`                   |

### Using the debugger in VS Code

Node.js debugging in VS Code is easy to setup and even easier to use.
Press `F5` in VS Code, it looks for a top level `.vscode` folder with a `launch.json` file.
